1. move the MPU or the battery so it is easier to insert the coin cell
2. The mounting hole is missing from the board. (1, 2, or 3 holes?)
3. Can the chip be programmed while it is attached to the board? Depends on connections?
4. the switch is not needed with "regular" LED. Could still be used for blink patterns?
5. Break out all the pins from the chip from now on. That way you can still prototype
   if there is some issue with the circuits. 

we can use the "optiboot" core and program the chip using USB to serial converter. 

## Burn Bootloader

- Use ARduino IDE 2.0.4 or later
- Add the "Arduino AVR Boards" from board manager.
- Upload the `src/ArduinoISP` sketch to the Arduino UNO.
- Connect board and "get board info", you should see serial number.

Pin details for ISP header:
// By default, the hardware SPI pins MISO, MOSI and SCK are used to communicate
// with the target. On all Arduinos, these pins can be found
// on the ICSP/SPI header:
//
//               MISO Â°. . 5V (!) Avoid this pin on Due, Zero...
//               SCK   . . MOSI
//                     . . GND
//
// On some Arduinos (Uno,...), pins MOSI, MISO and SCK are the same pins as
// digital pin 11, 12 and 13, respectively. That is why many tutorials instruct
// you to hook up the target to these pins. If you find this wiring more
// practical, have a define USE_OLD_STYLE_WIRING. This will work even when not
// using an Uno. (On an Uno this is not needed).

Choose Bootloader UART1 if you are using ISP header programming since the TX is on pin 8 and the RX is on pin 9.

const uint8_t  DATA_PIN   = PA5; // pin 8
const uint8_t  CLOCK_PIN  = PA4; // SCL pin 9

Choose board ATtiny441/841 with Optiboot. This allows programming via USB to Serial cable not just ISP header.
Programmer: ATtiny as ISP (ATtiny Core)

For USB to TTL, while viewing the BACK of the board:
- Green/Grey wire: TX out of the USB port, RX on the chip, connect to bottom center pin on ISP header next to green/grey.
- White wire: RX into USB port, TX on the chip, connect bottom left (below power).
- Black wire: Connect to negative (-) port on back, top right of ISP header.
- Red/Orange wire: Connect to (+) port on the back, top l;eft of ISP header.

Connect board, burn bootloader from board menu.
Then you can start uploading sketches


## Programming

Once you burn the bootloader to the chip, you can reflash many times using the easy USB to TTL cable.

[Add the ATTINY 841 using these directions](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/v2.0.0-devThis-is-the-head-submit-PRs-against-this/Installation.md#boards-manager-installation)

## Serial Console

pin13 SCK
pin12 MISO
pin11 MOSI
pin10 SS

You can make a serial connection to the badge using a USB to TTL serial cable.
For example: [USB to TTL Serial Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954)

- Green wire: Connect to serial port, right side looking at back.
- White wire: Connect to serial port, left side looking at back.
- Black wire: Connect to Battery port, negative (-) port.
- Red/Orange wire: Do not connect! This is +5V but the board is at +3V.
