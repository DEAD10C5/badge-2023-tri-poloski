1. move the MPU or the battery so it is easier to insert the coin cell
2. The mounting hole is missing from the board. (1, 2, or 3 holes?)
3. Can the chip be programmed while it is attached to the board? Depends on connections?
4. the switch is not needed with "regular" LED. Could still be used for blink patterns? 


we can use the "optiboot" core and program the chip using USB to serial converter. 

## Programming

[Add the ATTINY 841 using these directions](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/v2.0.0-devThis-is-the-head-submit-PRs-against-this/Installation.md#boards-manager-installation)

Choose board ATtiny441/841 with Optiboot. This allows programming via USB to Serial cable not just ISP header.
Programmer: ATtiny as ISP (ATtiny Core)

Choose UART1 if you are using ISP header programming since the TX is on pin 8 and the RX is on pin 9.

For USB to TTL, while viewing the BACK of the board:
- Green/Grey wire: TX out of the USB port, RX on the chip, connect to bottom center pin on ISP header next to green/grey.
- White wire: RX into USB port, TX on the chip, connect bottom left (below power).
- Black wire: Connect to negative (-) port on back, top right of ISP header.
- Red/Orange wire: Connect to (+) port on the back, top l;eft of ISP header.

Use a 0.1 micro farad capacitor across power and ground pins if the programmer is acting flaky.

Connect board, burn bootloader from board menu.
Then you can start uploading sketches
