1. move the MPU or the battery so it is easier to insert the coin cell
2. The mounting hole is missing from the board. (1, 2, or 3 holes?)
3. Can the chip be programmed while it is attached to the board? Depends on connections?
4. the switch is not needed with "regular" LED. Could still be used for blink patterns? 


we can use the "optiboot" core and program the chip using USB to serial converter. 

## Programming

[Add the ATTINY 841 using these directions](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/v2.0.0-devThis-is-the-head-submit-PRs-against-this/Installation.md#boards-manager-installation)

Choose board ATtiny441/841 with Optiboot. This allows programming via USB to Serial cable not just ISP header.
Programmer: ATtiny as ISP (ATtiny Core)

Choose UART1 if you are using ISP header programming since the TX is on pin 8 and the RX is on pin 9.
For USB to TTL, connect rx to pin8 TX and tx to PIN9 rx, gnd and optional power (power can come from arduino, etc.)
there is a 0.1 micro farad capacitor across power and ground pins.

Connect board, burn bootloader from board menu.
Then you can start uploading sketches
